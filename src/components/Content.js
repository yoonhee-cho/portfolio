                        Hello! I'm Yoon, a full-stack/ front-end developer with a passion for
                        crafting web applications with clean code and UI/UX that create practical solutions.
                       
                        </p>
                        <p className="about-text">
                        Previously, I worked as a handbag designer after getting my BFA in Accessories 
                        Design from Fashion Institute of Technology. Browsing innovative and fascinating
                        websites was just a hobby of mine. A hobby quickly turned into a passion and 
                        motivated me to enrolled at Parsons Schools of Design in Design and Technology.
                        After receiving my MFA degree, I attended The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack 
                        Academy to hone my programming skills. 
                        </p>

                        <p className="about-text">
                        I used to design and create complex patterns for handbags and small leather goods for fashion shows.
                        Now, I am fascinated with the similar kind of work â€“ but in a different industry. I love the achievement of learning and am excited to pursue a lifelong journey
                        of knowledge and problem-solving! <br></br><br></br>
                        When I am not coding, I am usually playing tennis, doing yoga, go camping and hiking,
                        cooking and watching documentaries about eco-friendly houses. 
                        </p>
