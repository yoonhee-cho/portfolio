                            This book is about my comfort food recipes. As I decided to eat less meat, especially because I didnâ€™t want to eat the meat product from the factory farming, 
                            I tried to gather the vegetarian recipes that are good for health. 
                            This book contains my childhood memories, nostalgic feelings, my past days in NYC, and the happiness 
                            that I feel now in my everyday life with my husband and our cat Mango.

                            <h4> Why</h4> <br></br>
                            <p className="body-text">
                            I was born and raised in South Korea and have lived in New York City since 2011. 
                            When I feel nostalgic, I cook Korean food. After eating what I made, I feel the energy is filled up from bottom of my gut. 
                            That way, my emptiness is filled, and my daily life keeps going on. 
                            
                            The reason I wanted to make this book is because it shows who I am and what I pursue. 
                            With this book, I want people who are interested in vegetable dishes to learn more about Korean food 
                            and enjoy the healthy food with reasonable cost.
